# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website – Gregory George

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a responsive, multi-page personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It showcases my front-end development skills, projects, and interactive form functionalities, and implements several core web development concepts as per assignment requirements.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and semantics
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, validation, dynamic features
- **VS Code** – Code editor
- **W3C Validator** – HTML and CSS validation
- **Git + GitHub** – Version control and deployment
- **Google Chrome** – Development and testing

---

## 🌟 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ HTML
- Semantic HTML5 structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`
- SEO meta tags for title, description, keywords, and author
- Image with `alt` text, links (absolute, relative, email, anchor)
- Embedded YouTube video (`iframe`) and interactive image map
- Ordered, unordered, and nested lists in the **About Me** section

### ✅ CSS
- Dark theme using CSS variables
- Responsive layout with media queries (2-column and 3-column grids)
- Animated text and image motion effects
- Hover and focus transitions for interactivity
- Custom styling for navigation, forms, and buttons
- Light/dark theme toggle using JavaScript and CSS class switching

### ✅ JavaScript
- Time-based greeting message shown on page load
- Form validation using regular expressions (`email`, `phone`)
- Theme toggle between light and dark modes
- Show/hide project details on card click
- DOM element styling on `focus` and `blur` with event listeners

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Ensuring Full Responsiveness**
**Challenge**: The multi-column layout broke on small screens.  
**Solution**: Media queries were used to shift to single-column layouts on tablets and mobile devices.

### 2. **Typing Animation Timing**
**Challenge**: Getting the typing animation to reveal one character at a time without showing full words.  
**Solution**: Used `steps()` in CSS with a count matching the number of characters in the text.

### 3. **Validating Form Inputs Without Plugins**
**Challenge**: No external libraries allowed.  
**Solution**: Used custom regular expressions and JavaScript form event handling for clean validation.

### 4. **Theme Switching Logic**
**Challenge**: Toggling themes without breaking layout or causing flickers.  
**Solution**: Applied class-based styling (`light-mode`) and CSS transitions, and positioned the toggle button for easy access.

## 📌 Final Note

This portfolio not only highlights my technical skills but also reflects my vision as a front-end developer. Every section was crafted to balance aesthetics, functionality, and responsiveness — with a touch of personality and interactivity.
